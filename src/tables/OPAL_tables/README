# Overview of directory files

The base directory of the source code contains the following text files by default:

- `GN93hz`: gives an overview of all currently available Rosseland-mean opacity tabulations from the OPAL project (126 tables in total). All tabulations assume solar abundances from Grevesse & Noels (1993).
- `Y09800`: example OPAL table for a pure helium atmosphere appropriate to model a wind outflows from classical Wolf-Rayet stars (hydrogen mass fraction $X=0$, helium mass fraction $Y=0.98$, metal mass fraction $Z=0.02$).

# Generating new tables

Different Rosseland-mean opacity tabulations can be used in a radiation-hydrodynamic simulation. The procedure for using a different Rosseland-mean opacity tabulation than the provided `Y09800` table is straightforward. First look up in the overview file `GN93hz` a suitable table, then copy its content into a new file, and save it accordingly in the current directory.

For example, when opacities from Table 92 are required, create a file with the following header in the current directory:

```
TABLE # 92     $G&N'93 Solar$     X=0.9000 Y=0.1000 Z=0.0000 dXc=0.0000 dXo=0.0000

It is important to not change the original file structure in order to avoid problems with reading in the table. In essence this means the newly created file containing a table should count 70 lines with different $log(T)$ values, as is standard for OPAL tables. Additionally, the name of the file containing the new table should not exceed 50 characters.

# How-to

There are essentially two ways to use a (new) OPAL opacity table in a simulation.

1. When using the FLD module of the code, the filename containing the table can be passed as a string to the `fld_opal_table` variable within the `fld_list` namelist. By default the FLD module will use the already included `Y09800` table.

2. When requiring the tables inside mod_usr.t the user needs to import some subroutines from `mod_opal_opacity.t`. Firstly, the table needs to be initialised by calling the subroutine `init_opal_table`. This should be done once inside the subroutine `initglobaldata_usr`. Secondly, to apply the values from the table to a given problem (e.g. boundary condition, source term computation), make a call to the subroutine `set_opal_opacity`.
See `mod_opal_opacity.t` for what arguments these subroutines require in their calls. An example of how to call OPAL tables inside the mod_usr.t file is given by the Wolf-Rayet stellar wind test problems of the rhd module. (NOTE: these test problems also rely on the FLD module, but this is not a prerequisite to use the tables.)
